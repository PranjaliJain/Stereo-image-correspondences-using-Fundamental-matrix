1. Take a stereo image pair of static scene as the input.
2. Estimate fundamental matrix between the stereo images.
3. For each point in the reference image, compute epipolar line in the source image.
4. Search along the epipolar line in the source image to find the corresponding point of each location of the reference image.
5. Create an image which is geometrically similar to the reference image using the image patches of the source image.
6. Show the comparison between the results obtained using in-built function and your implementation for the estimation of fundamental matrix.
7. Show results for atleast 5 stereo pairs.

In-built functions used for feature extraction and description using SIFT/SURF/ORB. Feature Matching and Fundamental matrix implemented from scratch.
