# Stereo image correspondences using Fundamental matrix from scratch
 
Python implementation of Fundamental matrix to find stereo image correspondances from scratch. The inbuilt implementation in opencv is compared with the implementation from scratch.

## Specifications:
1. Images of different scenes present in images/Scene(i) folder. Each such folder contains 2 images of the same scene. In all, Images/ folder contains 10 images.

2. Stereo image correspondance code implemented in python in fundamental_matrix.ipynb
   Use jupyter notebook to run the code. 

3. Results are compiled in the results/ folder. The results obtained from implementation from scratch are labelled with 'scratch', and the inbuilt ones are named with 'inbuilt'. 

## Libraries used:
- opencv
